In May, I got this Lenovo Thinkpad L440 laptop, but it's PCI wireless adaptor (Realtek 8192ee) could not work on Fedora 20. By checking this <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/rtl819x" target="_blank">Realtek 802.11n drivers</a>, I got that it's driver would be shipped on kernel 3.16, So I buy a usb wireless adaptor(NETGEAR WNA1100 AR9271) for temporary use.

Recently, by updating my laptop to kernel 3.16, the PCI wireless adaptor works, but does not work well. The wifi connection is very slow and unstable with large packages loss(by checking ping). So I searched for a resolution, and finally I got it by using <a href="https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/" target="_blank">rtlwifi_new</a>. 

###Downloading rtlwifi_new(mod name rtl8192ee)
>git clone http://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git

###Checking driver mod name on your platform
> lsmod | grep 8192ee

mod name(r8192ee) of mine is different from rtlwifi_new(rtl8192ee), so I need to remove and blacklist the old one.

###remove the old driver mod(optional)
>sudo rmmod r8192ee

For a mod removed by 'rmmod' will be loaded by reboot, I need to blacklist r8192ee

###blacklisting the old driver mod(optional)
>echo "blacklist r8192ee" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf


###install rtlwifi_new
>cd rtlwifi_new
>make
>sudo modprobe -rv rtl8192ee
>sudo make install
>sudo modprobe -v rtl8192ee

Job is done.
